This app is created as part of the [London App Brewery: Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart), I have attended on [LinkedInLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/flutter-part-08-powering-your-app-with-live-web-data).

## The Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. We looked at how to carry out time consuming tasks such as receiving the device location or receiving data from an API. 


## The Task

A weather app inspired by the designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). The App is capable of showing live weather data, based on the current device location. Furthermore, the weather for any other city can be displayed!
